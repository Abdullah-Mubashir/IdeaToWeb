# AI Frontend Generator

An intelligent web application that generates frontend code based on natural language descriptions. Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4, this tool can create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code from text descriptions, with built-in code quality checking and complexity analysis.



## 🌟 Features

- Natural language to frontend code conversion
- Automatic complexity analysis of requests
- Built-in code quality verification for complex requests
- Real-time code generation and preview
- Clean, modern UI
- Supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript generation
- Error handling and validation
- Mobile-responsive design

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)
- An OpenAI API key with GPT-4 access

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-frontend-generator.git
cd ai-frontend-generator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
PORT=3000
```

4. Create the required directories:
```bash
mkdir -p public/output
```

## 💻 Usage

1. Start the server:
```bash
node server.js
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

3. Enter your frontend requirements in the text area
4. Click "Generate Frontend"
5. View the generated code and preview the result

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | Your OpenAI API key | Yes |
| PORT | Server port (default: 3000) | No |

### OpenAI Model Configuration

The application uses two GPT-4 assistants:
1. Frontend Generator: Converts descriptions to code
2. Code Reviewer: Validates complex generations

You can modify their behaviors in `server.js`:
```javascript
const mathTutor = await createAssistant(
  "Math Tutor",
  "Your custom instructions here",
  "gpt-4o-mini"
);
```

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### POST /generate
Generates frontend code based on user description.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "question": "String describing desired frontend"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "filePath": "Path to generated file",
  "response": "Generated code",
  "isComplicated": boolean
}
```

## ⚡ Examples

1. Simple Button Generator:
```text
Create a blue button that says "Click Me" with hover effects
```

2. Complex Form Generator:
```text
Create a responsive contact form with name, email, message fields, 
and client-side validation
```

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)

## 🔒 Security

- The application sanitizes user input
- Generated files are stored in a protected output directory
- API key is secured through environment variables
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is properly configured

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Generated code may require manual optimization
- Complex requests may take longer to process
- Limited to frontend code generation (no backend code)
- Rate limits based on OpenAI API usage

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**
   - Ensure you're accessing the application through the proper server URL
   - Don't open the HTML file directly in the browser

2. **OpenAI API Errors**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check your OpenAI account has GPT-4 access
   - Ensure you have sufficient API credits

3. **File Generation Errors**
   - Check write permissions for the output directory
   - Verify the public directory exists
   - Ensure proper file paths in your code

### Solutions

For CORS issues:
```bash
# Always serve through Express
node server.js

# Then access via
http://localhost:3000
```

For permission issues:
```bash
# Set proper directory permissions
chmod 755 public/output
```
